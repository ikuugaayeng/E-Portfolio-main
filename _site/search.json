Rising temperatures significantly increase the demand for cooling energy, as the cooling load of buildings is heavily influenced by the amount of solar radiation reaching their surfaces. One of the most effective and sustainable strategies is urban greening. These interventions can take various forms, including street trees, urban parks, and vegetation surrounding buildings, all of which contribute to heat relief and improved urban resilience. Trees offer a wide range of ecosystem benefits that improve the climate and habitability of cities, including public spaces, by acting as natural shading and wind-shielding elements around buildings. By blocking solar radiation, trees help lower the energy needed for cooling, especially in buildings with poor window-to-wall ratios. This project contributes to NCAP’s goals by quantifying tree shade on buildings on UBC campus and analyzing its impact on building energy demand. Using high-resolution LiDAR data and sun position data, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) was created to represent campus elevation, and hillshade analysis was employed to simulate shade coverage at 15-minute intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Kuugaayeng\n\n\nSocial Planning Cowichan, Ongoing Project\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWestern Redcedar (Thuja plicata), an ecologically and culturally significant tree species in British Columbia, is increasingly threatened by climate stress, particularly prolonged droughts and soil moisture loss. This study aims to identify suitable planting sites for Western Redcedar across the Cowichan, Koksilah, and Chemainus River watersheds using a GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Five key environmental variables including elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), and soil conditions were assessed based on ecological relevance and processed into standardized raster layers. Each factor was reclassified into three suitability classes (Poor, Moderate, Good), and equally weighted. A composite suitability map was produced using a threshold approach, where areas meeting at least four out of five high-suitability criteria were classified as the suitable sites that support the growth redcedar. The resulting map highlights micro-sites that can support healthy cedar growth despite changing climate conditions. This work provides a valuable decision-support tool for conservation planner and Indigenous communities seeking to implement climate-adaptive forestry strategies and restore declining redcedar populations."

    "text": "LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing technology that measures highly accurate distances by emitting laser pulses onto the Earth’s surface to create 3D maps of objects and landscapes (Park et al., 2023; Roussel et al., 2020). This technology provides precise three-dimensional data about topography and surface features (Tooke et al., 2009).\nIn forestry, LiDAR is commonly used for mapping and assessing forests, including estimating tree heights and canopy structures (Roussel et al., 2020). In urban planning, it supports applications such as land use planning and infrastructure development (Dawood et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n\nLiDAR systems are broadly categorized into two main types: Discrete Return LiDAR and Full Waveform LiDAR. Each type collects data differently and serves distinct purposes depending on the application.\nDiscrete Return LiDAR, commonly used in terrestrial and airborne surveys, captures distinct return points from each laser pulse, producing a 3D point cloud of the scanned environment.\nFull Waveform LiDAR records the entire energy profile of the returning signal, offering a continuous vertical representation of surfaces, which is especially useful for analyzing complex vegetation structures or terrain in satellite-based applications.\n\n Figure 3: Types of LiDAR from Salas (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n✈️ Airborne LiDAR Mounted on drones or aircraft to map forests and terrain from above.\n\n\n🌲 Terrestrial LiDAR Stationary ground-based scanners used for capturing tree trunks and structural details.\n\n\n🛰️ Spaceborne LiDAR Satellite-based systems used for global ecosystem monitoring and elevation mapping.\n\n\n🚗 Mobile LiDAR Mounted on vehicles or backpacks for scanning roads and built environments while in motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiDAR works by emitting laser pulses from a sensor mounted on an aircraft or ground-based device. These laser pulses interact with objects and the Earth’s surface and then bounce back to the sensor. By precisely measuring the time it takes for the laser pulses to return, LiDAR can calculate the distance between the sensor and the objects or the ground surface.\nLiDAR creates a detailed 3D map of the surveyed area, including terrain, vegetation, buildings, and other objects. This data is valuable for various applications, including forestry (like estimating tree heights and canopy structure), urban planning, flood modeling, and more. LiDAR technology provides highly accurate and detailed structural information, making it essential for many scientific and environmental studies.\nThe most common format for discrete-return LiDAR point cloud data is a LAZ file (e.g., lidar_data.laz). LAZ files are a lossless compression of LAS files, which was the industry standard LiDAR data format for a long time. LAS files are still used somewhat, but given the vastly reduced file sizes of LAZ, LAZ has largely replaced LAS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure 1: Tree detection using LiDAR (GIF demo).\n\n\n Figure 2: Individual tree identification workflow using LiDAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R (lidR package) The lidR package is a free and open-source tool in R for processing and analyzing LiDAR data. It supports point cloud filtering, tree detection, DTM/CHM generation, and forest metrics.\n\n\n🐍 Python (PDAL) PDAL (Point Data Abstraction Library) is a powerful open-source library, similar to GDAL. It’s built in C/C++ but offers a robust Python interface. PDAL uses a pipeline system written in JSON, making it highly customizable.\n\n\n CloudCompare CloudCompare is an open-source tool designed for viewing, editing, and processing point clouds. It’s user-friendly and highly interactive, making it ideal for visual exploration of point clouds.\n\n\nLAStools This tool is ideal for efficiently processing large quantities of LiDAR data. It supports both command-line and GUI workflows, and it’s often used for automated pipelines."

It is one of the best available options for processing large quantities of data very efficiently. Historically it was a purely command line-based software program, and for complex data pipelines (and making LAStools calls from R, Python, etc.) the command line interface is still preferable. However, they have made strides towards making things a little more user friendly with GUIs. To access the full functionality of LAStools does require a license, but several of the tools are free to use."

    "text": "Common Tools for processing LiDAR\n\n\nCloudCompare\nCloudCompare is an open-source tool designed for viewing, editing, and processing point clouds. While it’s not as fast as LAStools for processing, it’s much more interactive and user-friendly. I personally find it especially useful for tasks like georeferencing LiDAR datasets, and it’s one of the easiest programs for navigating and exploring point clouds visually.\n\n\nLAStools\nwas one of the first major players in the lidar data processing world. It is one of the best available options for processing large quantities of data very efficiently. Historically it was a purely command line-based software program, and for complex data pipelines (and making LAStools calls from R, Python, etc.) the command line interface is still preferable. However, they have made strides towards making things a little more user friendly with GUIs. To access the full functionality of LAStools does require a license, but several of the tools are free to use."

    "text": "LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing technology that measures highly accurate distances by emitting laser pulses onto the Earth’s surface to create 3D maps of objects and landscapes (Park et al., 2023; Roussel et al., 2020). This technology provides precise three-dimensional data about topography and surface features (Tooke et al., 2009).\nIn forestry, LiDAR is commonly used for mapping and assessing forests, including estimating tree heights and canopy structures (Roussel et al., 2020). In urban planning, it supports applications such as land use planning and infrastructure development (Dawood et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n\nLiDAR systems are broadly categorized into two main types: Discrete Return LiDAR and Full Waveform LiDAR. Each type collects data differently and serves distinct purposes depending on the application.\nDiscrete Return LiDAR, commonly used in terrestrial and airborne surveys, captures distinct return points from each laser pulse, producing a 3D point cloud of the scanned environment.\nFull Waveform LiDAR records the entire energy profile of the returning signal, offering a continuous vertical representation of surfaces, which is especially useful for analyzing complex vegetation structures or terrain in satellite-based applications.\n\n Figure 3: Types of LiDAR from Salas (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n✈️ Airborne LiDAR Mounted on drones or aircraft to map forests and terrain from above.\n\n\n🌲 Terrestrial LiDAR Stationary ground-based scanners used for capturing tree trunks and structural details.\n\n\n🛰️ Spaceborne LiDAR Satellite-based systems used for global ecosystem monitoring and elevation mapping.\n\n\n🚗 Mobile LiDAR Mounted on vehicles or backpacks for scanning roads and built environments while in motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiDAR works by emitting laser pulses from a sensor mounted on an aircraft or ground-based device. These laser pulses interact with objects and the Earth’s surface and then bounce back to the sensor. By precisely measuring the time it takes for the laser pulses to return, LiDAR can calculate the distance between the sensor and the objects or the ground surface.\nLiDAR creates a detailed 3D map of the surveyed area, including terrain, vegetation, buildings, and other objects. This data is valuable for various applications, including forestry (like estimating tree heights and canopy structure), urban planning, flood modeling, and more. LiDAR technology provides highly accurate and detailed structural information, making it essential for many scientific and environmental studies.\nThe most common format for discrete-return LiDAR point cloud data is a LAZ file (e.g., lidar_data.laz). LAZ files are a lossless compression of LAS files, which was the industry standard LiDAR data format for a long time. LAS files are still used somewhat, but given the vastly reduced file sizes of LAZ, LAZ has largely replaced LAS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure 1: Tree detection using LiDAR (GIF demo).\n\n\n Figure 2: Individual tree identification workflow using LiDAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R (lidR package) The lidR package is a free and open-source tool in R for processing and analyzing LiDAR data.
