I used LiDAR, satellite imagery, and 3D spatial models to assess tree shade coverage and prioritize areas for nature-based solutions in urban planning.\nCurrently, I work as a GIS Technician Intern at Social Planning Cowichan, supporting the Cedar Project—an Indigenous-led initiative to restore and protect cedar ecosystems in the Cowichan Valley. I specialize in spatial analysis, map design, LiDAR processing, GPS integration, and custom mobile mapping applications.\nWith prior experience supporting municipal and regional planning projects in both Canada and Ghana, I am passionate about using GIS to inform sustainable land use, infrastructure planning, and climate resilience strategies.\n## Recent Publications\n\nUsing LiDAR to Map Urban Shade for Climate Adaptation\nIsaac Kuugaayeng, Dr. Nicholas Coops\nUBC, MGEM Capstone 2024\n\nGIS Applications in Indigenous-Led Watershed Planning\nIsaac Kuugaayeng, Social Planning Cowichan\nOngoing Research 2025"

    "text": "This is a sample page where you can archive project deliverables. Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){\n  ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red)\n  return(ndvi)\n}\n(Assuming nir and red are terra rast objects)\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir - red)/(nir + red)\n  return(ndvi)\n(Assuming nir and red are numpy arrays)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a Google Earth Engine application I developed - which I embedded in this webpage using the code below:\n\n\n&lt;iframe width=\"900\" height=\"700\"\nsrc=\"https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool\"&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nThe full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
